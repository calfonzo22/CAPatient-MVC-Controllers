# CAPatient-MVC-Controllers
Model-Views-Controllers Basic is a sample of a Web Site for a College Clinic. The following instructions will guide you in the process of bulding this SITE Maintance based in MVC.
# Objective
Recording and maintanance the patient information for a community clinic.
We need to install the database from a script, generate the models and create views to display and maintain the non-dependent tables:
* country
* diagnosisCategory
* dispensingUnits
* medicationType
* concentrationType.
# Database
The Database used is call Patients and it is installed from a script, as mentioned before.

# How to build the project
* Create an ASP.NET Core 3.1 project using MVC.  Call it CAPatients.  
  Remember to change the authentication to Individual User Accounts.
# Load the database to SQL, then generate the models & context for Entity Framework.
* Use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to execute the script and install the database.
* Generate the Entity Framework classes for the database into the project’s Models folder.  Name the context PatientsContext (which is the default for a database named “Patients”).
* Add the connection string to appsettings.json and add a service to Startup.cs to support dependency injection for database context PatientsContext.
# Modify the default layout’s footer.
* Put your name and section on the left side of the footer.  Your name should be a hyperlink causing the user’s e-mail client to create an email directed to your college email account.
* Move the menu’s hyperlinks for “Home” and “Privacy” from the menu bar to the right side of the footer, retaining their horizontal alignment.

* Generate a controller called CACountryController along with the required Views to enable full CRUD maintenance on the country table.  
* Add a link to it on the menu.
* Normally, pages do not display keys.  The key to this table is manually entered (and does not end in “ID”), so Razor provides it as an input on the Create view.
* Show the CountryCode on all views for this controller, but only allow the user to modify it on the Create view.  Ensure all views & hyperlinks function correctly: Edit is particularly sensitive to incorrect changes.
* Change the browser window title and the heading on the Index view to “Countries on File” or “List of Countries” instead of “Index” … less ambiguity for the user this way.
* a.	Change the browser titles and headings on the Details, Create, Edit and Delete views as well, to denote the table and action (“Edit Country”, and so on).

* Add a link for each controller to the menu.  
* Where the key is manually entered (dispensingUnit & concentrationUnit), display the key on all views, but only permit it to be modified on the Create view.
* Modify the browser title and page headings on each view to indicate the object type and the action performed by the page (“Create New Dispensing Unit”, “List of Diagnosis Categories”, etc.).  Generate controllers for the diagnosisCategory table, the concentrationUnit table, the dispensingUnits table, and the medicationType table … with the required Views to enable full CRUD maintenance.  
# In all Controllers:
* Ensure the controllers, their menu entries, and their actions all work.
* Comments are required to describe what each controller does and what each of its methods do.  
* Generated controllers have 9 methods (actions).
